# ðŸ’» My Cybersecurity & Networking Projects

Welcome to my personal portfolio of cybersecurity and networking projects! This repository is a collection of hands-on mini projects I've built using my home lab setup (Kali Linux VMs) to improve my technical skills and showcase practical knowledge in areas like cryptography, networking, and penetration testing.

Each project is organized in its own folder with documentation, steps, commands used, and relevant screenshots.
